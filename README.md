# SafeInvest: cost-aware advice with explicit limits

2026 HKUST(GZ) MCM Senior Group Problem A. Team **Lebmar**, number **87**.
Author: **Chengxuan YUAN**.

This repository records a reproducible investigation of purchasing-power risk,
customer suitability, selective rebalancing and bounded target updates. It does
not assume that a more complicated policy improves investment outcomes.

## Reproduce

Use Python 3.12 or later:

```sh
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
PYTHONPATH=src python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
python scripts/run_study.py develop
python scripts/run_study.py freeze
python scripts/run_study.py final
```

The committed result files are the archived study record. `freeze` and `final`
deliberately refuse to overwrite existing archives. For clean reproduction,
copy the repository to a separate directory and move its archived
`results/frozen` and `results/final` directories outside that copy first.
Do not remove or replace the original study record to tune against final data.

## Design

- Three-asset long-only portfolios; 100 units initially in bills.
- Explicit self-financing fees of 0.25% per amount actually transferred once.
- Growth, volatility and maximum drawdown measured in purchasing power.
- 1–80 fit, 81–120 architecture validation, 121–180 final evaluation.
- Four unguarded comparisons isolate target choice, execution and updates;
  two additional variants quantify the effect of review/pending behaviour.
- Scenario-level paired bootstrap; no annual-row pseudo-replication.
- Final access requires frozen source/configuration/data fingerprints.

The initial inventory exposed pooled market descriptive statistics across all
180 scenarios. No final strategy comparison or parameter selection was done
then. This limitation is retained in the protocol; we do not describe the
holdout as completely pristine. The formal modelling pipeline gates all final
returns until the model is frozen.

## Files

- `docs/protocol.json`: assumptions and selection rule fixed before validation.
- `src/safeinvest/`: accounting, loading, portfolios and causal policies.
- `tests/`: financial identities and timing/safeguard tests.
- `results/development/`: fitting and validation evidence.
- `results/frozen/`: final model, customer assignments and hashes.
- `results/final/`: held-out evaluation and sensitivity diagnostics.
- `docs/references.md`: verified primary citations and their claim boundaries.
- `report/`: English report source, figures and compiled review PDF.

## Data and AI use

The supplied data and problem statement are synthetic educational material,
distributed under **CC BY-NC-SA 4.0**. See `docs/DATA_NOTICE.md` and the retained
source attribution. Raw historical JST data are not substituted for the contest
scenarios. The questionnaire's loss tolerance is not a guarantee.

OpenAI Codex assisted with methods, code, testing, analysis and English drafting.
Independent automated review is recorded; the human author remains responsible
for checking the report and submission. No CMT upload is performed by this repo.
